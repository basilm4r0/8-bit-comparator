# Synchronous 8-bit Comparator

Two synchronous 8-bit comparators for signed two's complement notation written structurally in VHDL, including individual gate time delay simulation. The first uses a ripple adder, while the second uses magnitude comparators. The second component achieves a functional frequency of 7 MHz.

### Gate delays:
Gate | Delay
-|-|
Inverter | 2 ns
NAND | 5 ns
NOR | 5 ns
AND | 7 ns
OR | 7 ns
XNOR | 9 ns
XOR | 12 ns
